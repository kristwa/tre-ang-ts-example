VS example project
==================

This project is just a basic example project for a Visual Studio solution with an OWIN-based Web API server side and a client side using tools like NPM, Gulp and Bower to fetch and install prerequisites and Angular and Typescript for coding. It should work as a fine sample for the new Task Runner Explorer in Visual Studio. Please disregard the data model/sample data.

## Installation
* Clone the project

* Run
```
npm install
```

* Run
```
bower install
```

* Now you can use
```
gulp
```
in order to generate js/ts/css output, or use
```
gulp watch
```
to leave gulp watching your js/ts/css source files and automatically regenerate output on changes to files.
